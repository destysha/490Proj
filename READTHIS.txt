In this branch i have worked on the sample businessInv.php

In this version the second table on the page is connected to the database.
the user as able to 
	*view the table.
	*add a new entry to the table
	*edit any of the fields in the table by clicking a edit button.

I am currently working on the ability to delete a entry thats in the table.

SIDE NOTE:
	it took me more than 5 hours of non stop analysing extensively to get this to work after completing the coding because of typos. Although the code may look simple, trust me it was a pain in the fukin ass to get to work this far. Im hoping the Delete option isn't this extensive. semi colons are a bitch and paratases are the mother of all itches. -_-
