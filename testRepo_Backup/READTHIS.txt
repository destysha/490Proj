This branch15 is testing use
What did i do?
	I made a new database in local machine called
		SampleShop
	In there i have 2 tables:
	businessInv - users inventory with just 3 fields
			Product  Brand  Quantity
	ishopInv - ishops inventory of All Products and All Brands (sample)
		2 fields	Product  Brand

How this works?
	Once the user logs in from main page
	They are redirected to the UI page (userinterface/index.php)
	There they have the Main menu where they can click to go see their Inventory
		Their inventory is a list connected to the database 
		The list is reading the fields off of the table in db.
		They can view their Inventory and click a button IF they want to update 
		their inventory.
	They button redirects them to the ishopInv.php 
	this page has a table that is ALSO being read from the db.
	
	AT THE MOMENT i chose the easiest way to get the user to insert a product into their own inventory which is by making them fill out a form after viewing the table of options.
	Yes this is not the most ideal way but the main part is :
		*Get a user to SEE a list of option of product and brand 
		*Get a user to update their inventory based off this list
		*Cross reference their inventory with API and send Alerts
	Part 1 and 2 is done with this easy unefficient way BUT it is good for now.

	WHAT IS LEFT TO DO:
		*cross reference businessInv with API for recalls
		*alert user if there is any match
		*allow user to delete off of their inventory
	I think that's about it unless im missing something plz remind me.
